I am build the course here. Link to videos here.
[Elixir course here](/elixir-phoenix-liveview-build-tetris-kachori-game-free-course/)

The most import thing was to ship videos as soon as possible, however it were. And then keep improving them with iterations and feedback.


I used following tools.
I tried to make the videos more clear and readable code.

I was not sure if to host the video course.
Options in my mind were Udemy, Teachable, Gumroad or YouTube.

As the videos are going to updated in Iterations with time, YouTube was not a viable option. So I self hosted the videos and stream them online.

The videos are played 4X speed. sometime even 8X speed.

I used iMovie, HandBrake for video compression. But then maintaining quality was issue.
Friends also suggested use DaVinci code.

Audio, I still need to add audio voiceover and update the videos.
