<p>I am build the course here. Link to videos here.

<p>The most import thing was to ship videos as soon as possible, however it were. And then keep improving them with iterations and feedback.</p>

<p>I used following tools.
I tried to make the videos more clear and readable code.</p>

<p>I was not sure if to host the video course.
Options in my mind were Udemy, Teachable, Gumroad or YouTube.</p>

<p>As the videos are going to updated in Iterations with time, YouTube was not a viable option. So I self hosted the videos and stream them online.</p>

<p>The videos are played 4X speed. sometime even 8X speed.</p>

<p>I used iMovie, HandBrake for video compression. But then maintaining quality was issue.
Friends also suggested use DaVinci code.</p>

<p>Audio, I still need to add audio voiceover and update the videos.</p>
