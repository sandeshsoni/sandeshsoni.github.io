<p>I am building readrose app which is a quick bookmarking tool.
I wanted automatic classification of url.</p>

<p>As an end user, I will just bookmark the url and when I view it on my list of bookmarks, I expect them to be grouped together nicely and mention which tweets I have booked… which twitter handles or which blog posts.</p>

<p>I decided to use Regex and this is the beginning of story.</p>

<p>Regex in elixir is same as in any another languages.
Elixir does have something additional that can help more.</p>

<p>Let us play from the scratch.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">str1 = abc 123 456</code>
I want number from the string.
So, my regex will be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">expr = r\d\d\d</code></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">str1 = abc 123 456</code>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">str2 = abc 123-456</code>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">str2 = abc 123=456</code></p>

<p>So, if I bookmark a tweet, I will be able to see link to tweet as well as an individual link to author’ profile.</p>
